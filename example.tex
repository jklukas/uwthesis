%%%% The uwthesis.sty file relies on the memoir class!
%%%% You should be using the memoir class anyway; it makes life easier:
%%%% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/
\documentclass[oneside, letterpaper, 12pt, oldfontcommands]{memoir}

%%%% Import uwthesis.sty to get official formatting, then set your variables.

  An awesome study of important things is presented.  
  I further describe my project here, but I will not exceed 350 words, 
  for that is strictly forbidden for the abstract of this document.  
  If you're submitting online, you can even put symbols 
  in your abstract and title, but you'll have to find out the HTML 
  character codes for the various symbols.
